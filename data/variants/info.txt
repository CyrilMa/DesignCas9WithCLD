Description: here we detail the variants whose activity was tested, The sequence, computational scores and experimental validation are displayed 

id: name of the variant tested
batch: number of the batch, due to its complete failure and having been done through other methods, batch 1 was excluded from main
seq: amino-acid sequences
aligned_seq: amino-acid sequences with gaps to be aligned with PFAM16595 MSA
dna_seq: DNA sequence synthetized for cloning into E, coli
diff_spycas9: # mutation to SpyCas9
best_diff: # mutation to closest natural variant collected
e_rbm: RBM energy (negative PLL + log(Z))
c_rbm: score of the classifier (for recognizing pam TGG) of the SSL-RBM
fx_ddg: DDG calculed with FoldX to assess protein stability
fx_interenergy: Interaction energy calculated with FoldX
af2_tmscore: TM-score between AF2 model of wild-type and the one for the variant (calculated through M-score software)
af2_rmsd: RMSD between AF2 model of wild-type and the one for the variant (calculated through M-score software)
af2_plddt: pLDDT of the AF2 model
af2_ptmscore: pTMscore of the AF2 model
norm_repression: measured experimental activity (approximated to 0 for batch as the experiment was not conducted to term)
norm_repression_std: standard deviation measured over the 3 experiments
functional: level of functionality to use in tasks
