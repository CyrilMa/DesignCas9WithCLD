chimeras.csv
Description: Here we show the chimeras tested in sec 2.1 (protein sequence, origin, experimental results)

name: name of the natural Cas9 variant from which the PID was extracted
seq: amino-acid sequence
aligned_seq: amino-acid sequence with gaps to be aligned with PFAM16595 MSA
type: subfamily of the PID variant (see Collias et al. 2021)
pam: pam recognized according to Collias et al. 2021
identity: similarity to SpyCas9-PID
pam_tested: pam targeted to test the activity of the chimera
norm_repression: measured experimental activity
norm_repression_std: standard deviation measured over the 3 experiments
